Welcome to Poirot, fist competitive audit platform built on Solana! 

Poirot allows auditors to compete for prize pool funds by identifying bugs in protocol codes hosted on the Solana blockchain. With a fixed time length, auditors hunt for vulnerabilities, submit their findings through our platform, and await judgment from judges. Once the audit concludes, payouts are distributed based on the validity of the reported issues.

## Features

- **Competitive Auditing:** Auditors compete for prize pool funds by identifying bugs in protocol code.

- **Secure Platform:** Built on Solana, leveraging its robustness and security features of audits.
- **Payout Mechanism:** Payouts are distributed based on the severity, rarity and validity of the reported bugs.
