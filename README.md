Poirot allows auditors to compete for prize pool funds by identifying bugs in protocol code. With a fixed time length, auditors hunt for vulnerabilities, submit their findings through our platform, and await judgment from judges. Once the audit concludes, payouts are distributed based on the validity of the reported issues.

## Features

- **Competitive Auditing:** Auditors compete for prize pool funds by identifying bugs in protocol code.
- **Transparent Judging:** Judges evaluate the reported issues based on our platforms public rules.
- **Fixed Time Length:** Audits have a predefined duration, keeping the competition dynamic and engaging.
- **Payout Mechanism:** Payouts are distributed based on the severity, rarity and validity of the reported bugs. Algorithm that determines payout is being designed as of now.

Poirot-frontend stack: 

    Next.js, TypeScript, React Query, MUI, web3.js

Poirot-backend stack: 

    NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, web3.js, metaplex.js


v1 will include a functioning platform for completing audit contests.

Future versions are expected to include: 
- Games & challenges & prizes for upcoming Rust auditors
- Insurance pool mechanism
- Smartphone support
- Cross-chain audits ( why stop at Solana ? )
